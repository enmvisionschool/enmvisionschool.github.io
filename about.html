      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>
        ENM Vision School was established in 2010 by Ashutosh Kumar and his wife with only 4 students,
        driven by the desire to enhance education for economically weak students with a passion to study.
        It is a non-profit organization.

      <h2>Aim</h2>
      <p>
        Taking a step to build People, Society, and Nation.<br />
        This initiative helps needy students enhance their education, especially those willing to study
        but lacking strong financial support.<br />
        Currently, we are helping around 25-30 students.
